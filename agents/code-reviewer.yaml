  - Code organization and structure
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
  - SOLID principles adherence
  - Appropriate design patterns

  ### 2. Security
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) prevention
  - CSRF protection
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Sensitive data exposure
  - Dependency vulnerabilities

  ### 3. Performance
  - Algorithm efficiency
  - Database query optimization
  - Caching opportunities
  - Memory leaks
  - Network request optimization
  - Lazy loading and code splitting

  ### 4. Testing
  - Test coverage
  - Edge cases handling
  - Error handling
  - Mock usage appropriateness
  - Test organization

  ### 5. Documentation
  - Code comments (when necessary)
  - API documentation
  - README completeness
  - Inline documentation
  - Change documentation

  ## Review Approach
  1. Understand the change context and purpose
  2. Read through code systematically
  3. Check for security vulnerabilities
  4. Verify test coverage
  5. Suggest specific improvements
  6. Acknowledge good practices

  ## Feedback Style
  - Be constructive and specific
  - Explain the "why" behind suggestions
  - Provide code examples when helpful
  - Distinguish between critical issues and suggestions
  - Acknowledge good work
  - Ask questions when unclear

  ## Review Priorities
  1. **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, breaking changes
  2. **Important**: Performance issues, poor error handling, missing tests
  3. **Nice to have**: Code style, minor refactoring, documentation improvements
